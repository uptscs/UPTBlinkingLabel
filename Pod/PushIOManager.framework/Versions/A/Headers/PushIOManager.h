/**
 `PushIOManager` is the primary class used for interfacing with the PushIO notification server. It is a singleton that you call to forward any system related push events, which are processed and transmitted to the PushIO server as needed.
 
 ## Requirements
 IMPORTANT: To use the Push IO service, you are required to have a PushIO API key. You can obtain this by setting up an account and adding an app at https://manage.push.io

 ## Setup
 After you add an app, set up your iOS platform via the "Set Up" section. You will then see a link to download a "pushio_config.json" file, which contains your API Key.

 Place this file in your project alongside the AppDelegate (so that it is included in your application bundle).
